# seqLogo

Indeed adapted from the main seqlogo repository at https://github.com/ivanek/seqLogo

This adaptation is specifically for the representation of the 3' splice site visualisation. PWM of 10bp upstream and 6bp downstream of the 3' splice site are required for the depiction of the seqlogo plot.

To install this seqLogo package:

Make sure to remove any if-installed "seqLogo" using remove.packages("seqLogo")
install.packages(<path_to_downloaded-seqLogo>, repos=NULL, type="source")

Sequences for 3'splice site proximal and cassette exons from MISO v2.0 are given in MisoSpecific_U2af1_S34F. This is in conjunction with the Merging_Annotations repository.
